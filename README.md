# Health Insurance Cross-Validation

## Overview
This is a project to rank clients interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. The company SafeHarbor Insurance is a fictitious insurance company made up by us, 
in order to provide a business context for our problem. 

The data have been acquired in the challenge [Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction) 
from Kaggle, We perform exploratory data analysis, train different classification Machine Learning models, evaluate the metrics, and test their results.
